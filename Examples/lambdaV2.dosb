    lambdas have received a small update:
    Creating is the same, however you can 
    now specify the destination for the 
    result!
    -------------------------------------

lambda MyLambda ( x:1 y:r0 : x+y )

put 1 r0 
lambda MyLambda
prt acc ::END       -- prints the result "2"

put 3 r0 
lambda MyLambda -> r2 
prt acc ::END       -- still the same as the accumulator has not been touched
prt r2 ::END        -- prints the result "4"
